## Trigger Options

> Each promotion can be triggered immediately, after X seconds, after X pixels scrolled, after X% of the page scrolled, on exit, or event via your own Javascript Trigger.

> Each promotion can define its suppression cookie name and time of expiration in hours, ensuring your visitors don't get overwhelmed with promotions

> Each promotion can be displayed on all pages or have an explicit list of URL patterns or pages defined along with a suppression list that will supersede the first.

> And if multiple "Lightbox" type promotions are scheduled on the same page and meet the criteria to be displayed, only the most recently created promotions will be shown to the visitor.
